## Introduction

Reverse SSH tunneling is a powerful technique that allows you to establish a secure connection from a remote machine back to your local machine, even when the remote machine is behind a firewall or NAT.

## What is Reverse SSH Tunneling?

Reverse SSH tunneling, also known as reverse port forwarding, is a method for routing traffic from a remote machine back to your local machine through an SSH connection. This technique effectively "punches a hole" through firewalls, allowing you to access services on machines that are otherwise inaccessible from the internet.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Remote Access to Firewalled Servers**: Access machines behind corporate firewalls or NAT.
2. **IoT Device Management**: Manage IoT devices deployed in the field.
3. **Development and Debugging**: Access development servers running on local machines from anywhere.
4. **Remote Support**: Provide technical support to clients behind firewalls.
5. **Bypassing Network Restrictions**: Access services blocked by network policies.
6. **Secure Data Exfiltration**: Securely transfer data from a compromised machine (ethical hacking/pentesting).

## How Reverse SSH Tunneling Works

1. The client (remote machine) initiates an SSH connection to the server (your accessible machine).
2. The SSH connection is configured to forward a port on the server to a port on the client.
3. Traffic sent to the forwarded port on the server is tunneled through the SSH connection to the client.

## Setting Up a Reverse SSH Tunnel

### Prerequisites

- SSH access to a publicly accessible server (jump server)
- SSH client on the remote machine
- Admin rights on both machines

### Basic Setup

1. On the remote machine, run:

   ```bash
   ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 user@jump-server
   ```

   This command does the following:
   - `-R 19999:localhost:22`: Sets up a reverse tunnel, forwarding port 19999 on the jump server to port 22 (SSH) on the remote machine.
   - `user@jump-server`: The user and address of your publicly accessible server.

2. To access the remote machine, SSH to the jump server and then to the forwarded port:

   ```bash
   ssh user@jump-server
   ssh -p 19999 localhost
   ```

### Persistent Tunnel with AutoSSH

For a more robust setup, use AutoSSH:

1. Install AutoSSH:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install autossh
   ```

2. Create a startup script (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/reverse-tunnel.service`):

   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=AutoSSH reverse tunnel service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Environment="AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0"
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -M 0 -N -R 19999:localhost:22 user@jump-server -i /path/to/private/key

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Enable and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable reverse-tunnel
   sudo systemctl start reverse-tunnel
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. Use key-based authentication instead of passwords.
2. Limit the source IP addresses that can connect to the forwarded port on the jump server.
3. Use a non-standard port for SSH on the remote machine.
4. Implement fail2ban on the jump server to prevent brute-force attacks.
5. Regularly update and patch all systems involved.

## Troubleshooting

- Check SSH logs: `journalctl -u ssh`
- Verify the tunnel is active: `netstat -tlnp | grep ssh`
- Ensure proper permissions on SSH keys
- Check firewall rules on all machines involved

## Advanced Configurations

1. **Port Forwarding for Multiple Services**:

   ```bash
   ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 -R 18080:localhost:8080 user@jump-server
   ```

2. **Dynamic Port Forwarding (SOCKS Proxy)**:

   ```bash
   ssh -R 1080 user@jump-server
   ```

3. **Restricting Tunnels to Specific Interfaces**:

   ```bash
   ssh -R 127.0.0.1:19999:localhost:22 user@jump-server
   ```
