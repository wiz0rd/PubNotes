# Ansible Inventory TTP

## Goal
The goal of this TTP is to provide a comprehensive understanding of Ansible inventory, including how to create, manage, and effectively use inventories for network automation tasks.

## Overview
Ansible inventory is a collection of the hosts and groups you're managing with Ansible. This TTP covers static and dynamic inventories, inventory plugins, and best practices for organizing your network devices in Ansible.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Ansible (covered in the Ansible Basics TTP)
- Familiarity with YAML and INI formats
- Basic understanding of network device management

## Step-by-step Guide

### 1. Understanding Inventory Basics

Ansible can work against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansible's inventory file, which defaults to being saved at `/etc/ansible/hosts`.

### 2. Creating a Static Inventory

Create a basic inventory file in INI format:

```ini
[routers]
router1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1
router2 ansible_host=192.168.1.2

[switches]
switch1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
switch2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

[network:children]
routers
switches

[network:vars]
ansible_network_os=ios
ansible_user=admin
ansible_password=password
```

### 3. Using YAML Format for Inventory

Create an inventory file in YAML format:

```yaml
all:
  children:
    routers:
      hosts:
        router1:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.1
        router2:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.2
    switches:
      hosts:
        switch1:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.101
        switch2:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.102
    network:
      children:
        routers:
        switches:
      vars:
        ansible_network_os: ios
        ansible_user: admin
        ansible_password: password
```

### 4. Using Inventory Parameters

Ansible has several built-in parameters:

- `ansible_host`: The IP address or hostname to connect to
- `ansible_port`: The SSH port to connect to (default is 22)
- `ansible_user`: The username to use when connecting
- `ansible_connection`: The connection type (e.g., `network_cli` for network devices)

Example:

```ini
router1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1 ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=admin ansible_connection=network_cli
```

### 5. Creating and Using Group Variables

Create a `group_vars` directory in the same directory as your inventory file:

```bash
mkdir group_vars
```

Create a file for each group, e.g., `group_vars/routers.yml`:

```yaml
---
ntp_server: 10.0.0.1
syslog_server: 10.0.0.2
```

### 6. Creating and Using Host Variables

Similarly, create a `host_vars` directory:

```bash
mkdir host_vars
```

Create a file for each host, e.g., `host_vars/router1.yml`:

```yaml
---
interface: GigabitEthernet0/1
ip_address: 192.168.10.1
```

### 7. Using Patterns in Inventory

Ansible supports patterns for selecting hosts:

```bash
ansible routers -m ping  # All routers
ansible 'router*' -m ping  # All hosts starting with "router"
ansible 'router[1:3]' -m ping  # router1, router2, router3
ansible 'routers:switches' -m ping  # All routers and switches
```

### 8. Creating Dynamic Inventory

For dynamic environments, create a dynamic inventory script. Here's a basic example in Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import json

inventory = {
    'routers': {
        'hosts': ['router1', 'router2'],
        'vars': {
            'ansible_network_os': 'ios'
        }
    },
    'switches': {
        'hosts': ['switch1', 'switch2'],
        'vars': {
            'ansible_network_os': 'nxos'
        }
    },
    '_meta': {
        'hostvars': {
            'router1': {'ansible_host': '192.168.1.1'},
            'router2': {'ansible_host': '192.168.1.2'},
            'switch1': {'ansible_host': '192.168.1.101'},
            'switch2': {'ansible_host': '192.168.1.102'}
        }
    }
}

print(json.dumps(inventory))
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x dynamic_inventory.py
```

Use the dynamic inventory:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i dynamic_inventory.py playbook.yml
```

### 9. Using Inventory Plugins

Ansible provides inventory plugins for various sources. For example, to use the YAML inventory plugin:

```yaml
# inventory.yml
plugin: yaml
paths:
  - /path/to/your/inventory.yml
```

Use this inventory:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

### 10. Verifying Your Inventory

Use the `ansible-inventory` command to verify your inventory:

```bash
ansible-inventory --list -y
```

This will show you a YAML representation of your entire inventory.

## Advanced Topics
- Using Ansible Tower/AWX for inventory management
- Implementing custom inventory plugins
- Integrating with external inventory sources (e.g., CMDB, cloud providers)
- Using inventory for network discovery

## Troubleshooting
- Use `ansible-inventory --graph` to view the inventory hierarchy
- Check file permissions if Ansible can't read your inventory file
- Verify that dynamic inventory scripts are executable
- Use `ansible-playbook --list-hosts` to see which hosts a playbook will affect

## Best Practices
1. Use version control for your inventory files
2. Implement a naming convention for your hosts and groups
3. Use groups and subgroups to organize your inventory logically
4. Leverage group_vars and host_vars for better organization of variables
5. Use dynamic inventory when managing large or frequently changing environments
6. Regularly audit and update your inventory
7. Use vault to encrypt sensitive data in your inventory
