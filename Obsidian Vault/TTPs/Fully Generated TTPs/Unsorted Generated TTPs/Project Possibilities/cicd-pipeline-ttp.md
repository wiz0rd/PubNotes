# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation TTP

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to set up a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. By the end of this project, you will have automated the process of building, testing, and deploying your application, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.

## Overview
This TTP provides detailed instructions for implementing a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD, covering the entire process from code commit to production deployment.

*Figure 1: CI/CD Pipeline Overview. Replace with an actual image showing the stages of your CI/CD pipeline.*

## Prerequisites
- A GitLab account (you can use GitLab.com or self-hosted GitLab)
- Basic understanding of Git version control
- Familiarity with your application's build and deployment process
- A sample application to use in the pipeline (e.g., a simple web application)

## Step-by-step Guide

### 1. Set Up Your GitLab Repository

1. Create a new project in GitLab
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### 2. Create a GitLab CI/CD Configuration File

In your project's root directory, create a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

test_job:
  stage: test
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  image: ruby:latest
  script:
    - apt-get update -qy
    - apt-get install -y ruby-dev
    - gem install dpl
    - dpl --provider=heroku --app=your-heroku-app --api-key=$HEROKU_API_KEY
  only:
    - main
```

This example assumes a Node.js application deployed to Heroku. Adjust according to your stack.

### 3. Configure CI/CD Variables

In GitLab, go to Settings > CI/CD > Variables. Add any necessary variables, such as:

- `HEROKU_API_KEY`: Your Heroku API key

![GitLab CI/CD Variables](https://example.com/path/to/gitlab_cicd_variables.png)
*Figure 2: GitLab CI/CD Variables configuration. Replace with an actual screenshot of the GitLab CI/CD Variables page.*

### 4. Commit and Push

Commit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and push to your GitLab repository:

```bash
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitLab CI/CD configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Monitor Pipeline Execution

In GitLab, go to CI/CD > Pipelines to see your pipeline running.

### 6. Implement Code Quality Checks

Add a job for code linting:

```yaml
lint_job:
  stage: test
  image: node:14
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run lint
```

### 7. Add Security Scanning

Incorporate security scanning using GitLab's built-in scanners:

```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml
  - template: Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml
```

### 8. Implement Continuous Deployment

For automatic deployment on successful builds, ensure your `deploy_job` is configured correctly and add:

```yaml
deploy_job:
  # ... (previous configuration)
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://your-app-url.com
```

### 9. Set Up Review Apps

For dynamic environments per merge request, add:

```yaml
review_app:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to review app"
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    url: https://$CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG.example.com
    on_stop: stop_review_app
  only:
    - merge_requests

stop_review_app:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Remove review app"
  when: manual
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
    action: stop
```

### 10. Implement Multi-Stage Deployments

Add stages for different environments:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy_staging
  - deploy_production

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy_staging
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to staging"
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.your-app-url.com

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy_production
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to production"
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://your-app-url.com
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

## Advanced Topics

- Implementing canary deployments
- Setting up Docker image builds in the CI pipeline
- Integrating performance testing in the pipeline
- Implementing infrastructure-as-code with your CI/CD pipeline

## Troubleshooting

- If jobs fail, check the job logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly
- For deployment issues, verify your deployment credentials and permissions
- Use GitLab's CI lint tool to validate your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

## Best Practices

1. Keep your CI/CD configuration under version control
2. Use caching to speed up your pipeline
3. Parallelize jobs when possible to reduce pipeline duration
4. Use GitLab environments to track deployments
5. Implement proper secret management using CI/CD variables
6. Regular
ly update your base Docker images and dependencies
