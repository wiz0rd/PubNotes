# Ansible Network Management Project - Main TTP

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to implement a comprehensive Ansible-based solution for managing a multi-vendor network infrastructure. This project will cover everything from Ansible basics to advanced network automation techniques, including testing with containerlab/netlab and phased deployment to production environments.

## Overview
This main TTP provides an overview of the entire project and links to individual TTPs that cover specific aspects of Ansible-based network management.

   - Best practices for role development

3. [[Ansible Variables TTP]]
   - Variable types and scopes
   - Using variables in playbooks and roles
   - Variable precedence and best practices

4. [[Ansible Packages TTP]]
   - Managing Ansible packages
   - Using ansible-galaxy
   - Creating and sharing custom packages

5. [[Ansible Inventory TTP]]
   - Creating and managing inventory files
   - Dynamic inventories
   - Inventory plugins for network devices

6. [[Network Backup Playbook TTP]]
   - Daily configuration backups
   - Creating a "latest" directory for scraping
   - Version control for network configurations

7. [[Security Baseline Templates TTP]]
   - Creating security baseline templates
   - Applying templates to multiple platforms
   - Ensuring compliance across the network

8. [[Device Onboarding Playbook TTP]]
   - Automating new device onboarding
   - Configuring TACACS and SNMP
   - Standardizing initial device setup

9. [[Image Deployment Playbook TTP]]
   - Automating network device image upgrades
   - Configuring SFTP/SCP for image transfer
   - Verifying and rolling back upgrades

10. [[Containerlab/Netlab Testing TTP]]
    - Setting up a virtual network testing environment
    - Integrating Ansible with containerlab/netlab
    - Validating playbooks in a test environment

11. [[Phased Deployment Strategy TTP]]
    - Developing a phased deployment approach
    - Testing in virtual environments
    - Gradual rollout to production networks

## Implementation Workflow

1. Set up Ansible environment and learn basics
2. Develop roles and playbooks for specific tasks
3. Create and manage inventory for your network
4. Set up containerlab/netlab testing environment
5. Test playbooks in the virtual environment
6. Implement phased deployment to production
7. Continuously monitor, update, and improve automation

## Best Practices

1. Use version control (e.g., Git) for all Ansible code
2. Implement proper error handling and logging in playbooks
3. Use ansible-lint to ensure playbook quality
4. Regularly update Ansible and related packages
5. Implement proper access controls and authentication for Ansible
6. Document all roles, playbooks, and variables thoroughly
7. Use tags in playbooks for selective execution of tasks
8. Implement idempotency in all playbooks

## Glossary

- **Ansible**: An open-source automation tool that can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows
- **Playbook**: A file containing one or more plays, each defining a set of tasks to be executed on specified hosts
- **Role**: A way of organizing playbooks and other files to facilitate sharing and reuse of code
- **Inventory**: A file or script defining the hosts and groups upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate
- **Module**: A unit of code that Ansible executes, usually on the remote managed nodes
- **Task**: A unit of action in Ansible, usually calling a module with specific arguments
- **Handler**: A task that only runs when notified by another task
- **Fact**: Information derived from speaking with remote systems
- **Idempotency**: The property of certain operations whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application
